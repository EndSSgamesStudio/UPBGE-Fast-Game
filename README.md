Do not know UPBGE?
so I think I should get to know her! [Here!](https://github.com/EndSSgamesStudio/Addon_Upbge_Game_Objects/releases)

**What is the UPBGE?** üòê

UPBGE (Uchronia Project Blender Game Engine) is a fork of Blender created by Porteries Tristan (a Blender Game Engine developer) and some of his friends in September 2015.

It's an independent branch, and its aim is to clean up and improve current Blender Game Engine (BGE) code, experiment with new features, and implement forgotten features that currently exist but have not been merged with the official Blender trunk.

Currently, after the Blender Foundation's decision to delete BGE from next 2.8 release UPBGE becomes, de facto, the only one to follow the development of the Game Engine. This gives us even more freedom, if possible, to make certain decisions, since we will never, in any way, come into conflict with the official version.
UPBGE is evolving more and more!
